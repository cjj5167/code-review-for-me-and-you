### The argument against code review

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Ain't nobody got time for that!
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> I reviewed it and can confirm that it is, in fact, code.
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Death by a thousand paper-cuts

Note:

* Good code review takes time
    - Larger the review, the more uninterrupted time needed
* If the code's not earnestly being reviewed, it's a charade and a waste of time
* Conversely, some people get *too* into reviews, and it becomes nitpicky and unhelpful
    - That's not how _I_ would have done it!
