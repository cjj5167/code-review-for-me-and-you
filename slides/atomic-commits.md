### Practice Atomic Commits

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Make each commit as small and focused as possible
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Commits are cheap, go wild!

Note:

* Each commit should be small and focused, touching as little as possible
* Branching and commits are cheap, so commit early and often
* Way easier to see what's changed, why it changed, and make reverts far less painful
