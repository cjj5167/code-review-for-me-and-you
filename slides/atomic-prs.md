###  Atomic PRs

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> PRs should be as small + focused as possible
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Smaller PRs = shorter feedback loop

Note:

Likewise, the PRs we open should be as small as reasonably possible; there's a big difference between going through ten small PRs with a few changes each compared to one large PR that touches a ton of files.

Smaller PRs make reviews much faster, which means it's easier for your colleagues to review them between meetings or when they need a brief distraction; the code review that takes an hour to do likely won't get done until the last minute.
