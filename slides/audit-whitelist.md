### Audit the whitelist

> If an app isn't working right but all the tests pass, the first place you should look are the areas where test coverage has been ignored.

Note:

* Testing tools, sniffers, etc. usually permit errors to be whitelisted
* Make sure you're periodically auditing these to ensure code isn't just being ignored without reason
* Easy to get 100% test coverage if you just skip anything that's untested!
