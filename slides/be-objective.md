### Be Objective, not Subjective

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Put aside personal feelings and opinions, and try to provide objective feedback
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Provide resources (where appropriate)
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Ask questions!

Note:

* Important to put aside "that's not how I would do it" and instead focus on providing objective feedback
* Instead of citing "best practices", link to relevant docs
* If something doesn't make sense, ask the developer why the approached it a certain way
    - Forces the dev to re-evaluate
