### Building a Culture of Code Review

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Make code review an integral part of your team's workflow
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Empower every member of your team to request a review
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> If it's not important enough to review, it's not important enough to ship

Note:

* Best way to ensure code reviews get done is to make them a part of the workflow.
    - Reviews are not a "sometimes" thing
* Everyone should be able to request a review, and should feel empowered to jump into one, too
    - Great learning opportunity, and the more eyes the better
* No shortcuts; hotfixes mean emergency code reviews, not skipping the process entirely.
