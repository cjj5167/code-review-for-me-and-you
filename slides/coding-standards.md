### Coding Standards

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Determine coding standards at the beginning of the project
    * WordPress v PSR-2 v. PEAR v. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Determine _what_ gets reviewed
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Above all else, **be consistent!**

Note:

* Consistent standards == fewer merge conflicts and a more readable codebase
* Pick a standard for each project and try to stick to it
    - WP = WordPress coding standards
    - Composer package = PHP Standard Recommendation (PSR) standards
* What's important? Security? Performance?
* Are reviews always required, or only for larger changes?
