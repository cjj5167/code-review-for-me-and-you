### Exercise Two

**Context:** WordPress Theme

```php
/**
 * Echo the string "Something".
 */
function echoSomething()
{
    $message = "Something";

    echo $message;
}
```

Note:

* Does it work?
* Does it work well?
* Does it meet our standards (WordPress coding standards)?
    - Camel-cased function name
    - Braces
    - Unnecessary double-quotes
    - Unnecessary variable assignment
* Will revisit this sample later ;)
