### Formal code review

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> An **official** part of your development workflow
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Development &rsaquo; Code Review &rsaquo; Merge
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Pair programming
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> "Bug sweeps"

Note:

* An official part of team's development workflow
* Every (major) change gets reviewed before merge
    - Pair programming? Essentially already doing this!
* Bug sweeps = larger chunks are reviewed after merging
