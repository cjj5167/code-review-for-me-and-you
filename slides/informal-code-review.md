* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Not (just) workflow, but culture
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Ad-hoc check-ins
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> "Hey, can you gut-check this?"

* Over-the-shoulder checks or poking around commit history on GitHub
* Requires a culture of respect; competitive types need not apply
