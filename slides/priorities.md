### Code Review Priorities

1. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Does it work?
2. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Does it work well?
3. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Does it meet our standards?

Note:

Prioritize feedback:

1. Does the code do what it's designed to do, and/or does it break anything else?
2. Are there potential security/performance issues (escaping, sanitization, etc.)
3. Does it adhere to the coding standards and other rules?
