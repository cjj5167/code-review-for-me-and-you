### Static code analysis

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Examine the code without running it
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Detect areas that are overly-complex or missing tests
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Great addition, but not a replacement!

Note:

* Often sold as "automated code reviews"
* More advanced than tools like ESLint or PHP_CodeSniffer, which check syntax
* Great at satisfying the "does it work well?" priority
* Can be a great addition to a project, but these tools lack the insight to be a full replacement
    - Bus factor also goes up
* Examples: Code Climate, Codacy, Jetbrains' Upsource
