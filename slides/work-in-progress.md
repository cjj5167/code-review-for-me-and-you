### WIP: Work in Progress

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Convention for "this might not be fully-ready for review"
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Opportunity to have discussions and on-going reviews
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Keep notes related to a specific branch

Note:

* WIP is a common convention for reviews that have been started but are still under active development
* Great for early feedback ("does this approach make sense?")
* For more complicated branches, can help keep track of changes
